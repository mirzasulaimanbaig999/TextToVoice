# Permanent Instructions
instructions = """
For Arabic text: Recite exactly like a professional Qur’an qāri’ with full tajweed. Use very long qirāʾt: stretch the vowels (madd) fully, elongate every sound naturally, sustain ghunnah (nasal sounds), and apply proper waqf (pauses) at the end of each verse. The Arabic recitation must be delivered in a strong, clear, and resonant voice — louder and more powerful than the English narration — with depth and richness, like an imam reciting in a masjid. Keep the recitation extremely slow, soulful, and natural, with realistic breathing and deep reverence. It must sound completely human and never robotic.  

For English text: After completing each Arabic verse, always narrate the English translation. Do not skip any English text. Use the natural strength of the Fable voice: calm, professional, warm, and clear, similar to David Attenborough or a BBC World Service presenter. Speak with measured pacing, smooth emphasis, and a respectful, documentary-style delivery. The English narration must sound fully human, like a professional audiobook.  

Always separate Arabic and English with a clear, natural pause. Arabic should flow like a live qirāʾt recitation in a strong and resonant voice, while English should follow in a softer, professional narration tone — creating a balanced, natural experience.
